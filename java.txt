create entity class
@Autowired
plain old java object
@RequestMapping(method=GET) 

springboot has an embedded tomcat
@EnableEurekaServer
H2 in-memory database


import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner scanner=new Scanner(System.in);
entity class
controller class
repository is an interface which extends mongo or JPArepository


it contains projects details required to
while executing


@Autowired    dependency injection is based on principle of inversion of control


ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);



im tkg a dy of tdy de 2 a mdl emry



microservices-here we are considering each feature as a service


entity-controller-repository
mongodb is a nosql database
i hv gone through the java full stack 
traning provided by dxc .after that traning got into iot team where i was 
working on an application which tracks the asset order


spring starter project
in model class use
Entity for mysql
Document for mongodb   @Document(collection="collectionname")
repository should be an interface which extends JPArepository or MongoRepository here we have to 
pass the Model class name and primary id type 
if we are posting data public String posting(RequestBody Book book){
repo.save(book)
model-controller-repository-extends mongorepository
in application class we have @SpringBootApplication
spring mvc-is a java framework it follows model-view- controller design pattern
in mvc view uses jsp jstl for creating view -java server pages
dependency injection-3 classes
1. client class
2.service class
3.Injector class

3 types of DI
1.constructor
2.setter
3.Interface

in pom.xml we include all the dependencies
ConfigurableApplicationContext 
 


creating a web application using rest-   

create a (WebApp) folder in src-main-WebApp  
create a jsp file inside the folder course.jsp 
this is  view which an user can see  
jsp file to servlet 
model-controller-repository-mong
@Auotwired 
jsp-view 
angular for the view
if u give input type as
methodName(@RequestParam("cid") String cus
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
basically we are trying to create a web application
1. create a springboot application
2. create a model class -custimer.java
3.create a jsp file inside webapp folder
4. in jsp file indise the body tag create a form 
5. create another class and name it as a controllerclass
5.add jasper dependency in pom.xml to convert jsp to servlet
6.add server.port in application.properties  
............................
in controller class return jsp file for requestmapping which contains a form
in memory database is H2 database   
if u declare  a model class as @Entity which creates a table in database while executing
......................................
7.To save data into database create an repository which is an interface and it extends crudrepository or jparepository

RequestMapping annotation is used to map web requests onto specific handler classes and/or handler methods.



it will send the data either in the form or json or the xml format 
REST-Representational State Transfer -Create Read Update Delete operations
create-post
read-get
update-put
delete-delete
                    
......................................................
json-JavaScript Object Notation
......................................................
rest api-
i want to get temperature at any place-server
REST is a stateless client -server architecture
hen compared to SOAP web services, these are lightweight and doesn’t follow any standard.
We can use XML, JSON, text or any other type of data for request and response.
 whereas SOAP works with XML only

web service is a way for two machines to communicate with each other over a network

..............
Data structure means organizing the data in computer so that it can be used effectively 
what is the difference between data structure and collecction framework
 
.....................................
json -java script object notation -json is a format in which we can transfer data from client to server and vice versa 
if a client makes a asynchronous request to server then server will send a response to that request.
the response can be in any form ( html,text,json,xml).
if the response is in json format it is easy to fetch the data from it
..........................................
http- when you type url in browser and hit enter it will make a request to web server .server response with a resource.
..........................................


we will look for 
xml  - e ml

jdk-to know jdk is installed type javac in command prompt.
to know the version of it type java -version in command prompt 
we have  to install the jdk from oracle official website

@SpringbootApplication encapsulates @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
used to declare main class of SpringbootApplication 
........
@EnableAutoConfiguration Spring Boot looks for auto-configuration beans on its classpath and automatically applies them.
........

NullPointerWException
ClassCastException
    ArrayList<String> alias= new ArrayList<String>(); 
index and the controller mainly to apply security constraints to jsp pages
loopme as well so that i can check this one

AppSecurityConfig tag is used to provide
there will be an configuration file
AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer extend this class
public class SecurityWebApplicationInitializer  
    extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer {  
  
}  
The @Requestmapping annotation is used to map the class with the specified URL name
i got updates from my manager he has back to back meetings so he will meet us end of the day
any updates from manager?yeah tell me whatall the documents i need to include if i get
whatever u did is it still rung?
HTTP request-dispatcher servlet is a front end controller

we will see how to take it forward i will talk to prasad then we will see how to take it forward.

spring security framework is used to create secured enterprise application by providing authorization and authentication
spring security 3.0   spring boot version 2.2.1  tomcat version is 9
in web application user can create read the articles a if u tell some configuration trust me
............
authentication is who u are mainly the username and the password
autherizatuion is the role

.........
1.create a springboot starter project
2.select web-jpa-security
3.create a controller class       
   3.1 annotate controller class with @Controller 
   3.2 create a method which return a home.jsp file
4.create a folder (webapp) under src-main where we have to put all our jsp pages
5.create a jsp file named home.jsp inside webapp
6.to work with jsp we have to add jasper dependency in pom.xml file
7.to add spring security module to spring boot project add springboot-starter-security dependency to your project

8.create a class to provide configuration which extends WebSecurityConfigureAdapter 

  8.1 create a method with return type AuthenticationProvider
  8.2 create an object of DaoAuthenticationProvider
9.create a table in db .
