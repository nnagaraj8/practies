in spring we are using maven build tool so just need to define dependencies  in pom.xml
file.
minimal requirement in pom.xml is groupid,artifactid ,version
maven is a project management tool

remote library we need to include in pom.xml

deploys artifact to the remote repository

clean up after build.
compiles java source code.
deploys the artifact to the remote repository.
installs the built artifact into the local repository.

J2EE-servlets and jdbc
........................................
We know that Spring is a java based framework. 
But why do we need a framework when same application can be done using j2ee i.e.
servlets and jdbc. It was done in the same way before frameworks, but in this line of code which a developer has to write was much more making it much complex. In developing this kind of application it needs long period of time and excessive effort. So to remove this much kind of effort we turn to frameworks where all these issues are minimised. Thus developer will be investing in the task and not in the technology.

Now we know benefit of a frameworks, let us discuss the advantage of spring 
framework. Spring is known for its many features, let us discuss some its 
features. One is IoC which is inversion of control and other is DI which is
dependency injection. In spring due to Ioc we do not have look up for objects, 
instead they are provided by IoC. DI is the cherry on top which is provided by Spring. Other then spring everywhere we try to find the objects and their dependencies i.e. we try to pull congiguration, but DI is a push configuration means it pushes congfiguration into application objects. Thus they are making quite efficient environment for developers.

Apart from these spring also provides various modules like Spring MVC,
 Spring Security, Spring ORM, Spring Core which comes in handy for the developer
whose whole effort goes to investing in the task i.e. application and not in setting configuration. Also it provides integration with other frameworks in a much easier way. Now i think it should be clear why developers are opting for this Spring framework.


in hibernate as well we can either have mapping file or annotations
here in spring as well we can either havexml based configuration or annotation based configuration
there are some containers they are responsible for creating an object and inject them into ur project for that
we have to do a lot of configuration earlier days we used to create a xml file and used to give all the dependencies
why do we use dependency injection is mainly to achieve loosecoupling

maven can be used for many purpose but the main purpose is to get dependencies it is also used for 
instead of downloading all the dependencies u just have to create a maven project and 
define all the dependencies in pom.xml file .maven will dowload the dependencies from 
remote repository.
invertsion of control
dependecy injection
the overall flow
jsp and servlet
if u create a java project that means it is a simple core java project
archtype quickstart to create a desktop applixation 
archtype webapp to create a web application if u are using core java application then it is a jar file
and if u r using a web application then it is a war file
if u using a simple java project just create a java application
getBean is a method which we can use from either BeanFactory or ApplicationContext
if u r creating an enterprise application use ApplicationContext bcz applicationContext is a super set of 
BeanFactory
create a xml file and mention which class object need to be called when vehicle keyword is passed .
in xml file use beans tag inside that use bean tag in that write id property

we have to write the definition of beans tag


first create a class and write a method in it
create another class with the same method in it
create an interface with the same method. classes extends those
in main class if u create an object of 1 class it is difficult to call the method of another class
so we need to go for spring bean  use either aplicationcontext or beanfactory
but applicationcontext is a super class of beanfactory
so ApplicationContext context =  new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();
Vehicles obj = (Vehciels)context.getBean();
Create an xml fiel with as follows,

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<beans  xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.0.xsd">
<bean  id="vehicle" class="com.dxc.dtc.Customer">
</bean>
</beans>
 
 always create an object of child and the type of parent
if we declare a class as a component we no need to define beans in the configuratuion class
that means we need object of those classes
also need to declare @componentscan tag in config file
@Primary
@Qualifier
...
created maven project
add spring dependency in pom.xml(spring core,spring web,spring expression)
in app.java class created object of beanfactory
 in xml

ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

Inversion of control (IoC) is the principle where the control flow
 of a program is inverted: instead the programmer controls the flow 
of a program, the external sources 
(framework, services, other components) take control of it. As the 
name implies Inversion of control means now we have inverted the control of
 creating the object from our own using new operator to container or framework.
 Now it’s the responsibility of container to create object as required.
there are two types of containers
1.bean factory
2.Application context

dependency lookup makes the code tightly coupled.
if resource is changed we need to perform a lot of modifications in the code.

singleton class is a class which can have only one object at a time
in general we can create multiple objects of a class. 

allowing only 1 instance of a class is known as singleton class.
design patterns in java
   
public  access level of public modifier is everywhre  
private within the class
protected within the same package and outside the package through child class.

static:static variables- memory is allocated for static variables only once
when there is a common property for all the objects then make use of static variable.

collections
collection is a group of object represented as a single unit.c

collection provides an arcitecture ti store and manipulate group of objects.


the root interface is 
--Iterable
-- Collection interface extends iterable
==set queue list extends collection interface
--list interface i mplementation is provided by 3 classes
1. Arraylist
2.LinkedList
3.Vector
-- queue implementation is provided by priority queue
--set implemetation is provided by hashset and linked hashset
what is the maeaning of thread safe?
.............
array-fixed size
arraylist size is dynamic
arraylist can have duplicate values and accessed using index
array length using length method
arraylist length using size() method
Array use assignment operator to store elements but ArrayList use add() to insert elements.
 You can not store primitives in ArrayList, it can only contain Objects. While Array can contain both primitives and Objects in Java.

ArrayList<String> list1 = new Arraylist<String>();---this list1 can store String objects
ArrayList list1= new ArrayList();---list1 can store any type of object
root class of any class is Object class.

Iterator<String> itr= list1.iterator();
wile(itr.hasnext()){
syso(itr.next()):
}
......
queue
queue is always FIFO approach
ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList<String>();
PriorityQueue<Integer> q= new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
priority queue sorts the data in ascending order
there are mainly 2  operations,
1. peeking-finding the head of the queue
2.polling-removing the head of the queue
..........

set-hashset,linked hash set,tree set
set cannot contain duplicate values
hashset uses hashing technique to storeonly unique values
linkedhashset stores the data but it also maintains the order of insertion
Treeset uses a tree for storage in tree set data are stored in ascending order 

hashset-data is unique,data is not in the order due to hashing

linkedhashset-maintains the insetion order
treeset- data is unordered but sorted in ascending order
array static
so we go for arraylist
arraylist is dynamic
linkedlist
