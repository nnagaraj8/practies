Structured Query Language
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
record-row
field-column
database is an organized collection of data
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive
SQL COMMANDS:
SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE,DROP TABLE,INSERT INTO
................
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER
...
SELECT CUSTOMERNAME FROM CUSTOMER
........
SELECT customername,city from customer
...
SELECT DISTINCT city from customer  [to extract distinct data present in a column]
...
Select count(DISTINCT country) FROM customers;  
...
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE COUNTRY= 'Mexico';
...
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE COUNTY = 'MEXICO' and CUSTOMERID=1;
...
in where clause we can use
..
< > <= >= BETWEEN 
...
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID IN (50,60,78);
...
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '%s';
...
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');
...
order by clause is used to sort the result-set in ascending order or descending order
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
...
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;
...
insert into statement is used to insert new recors into a table
...
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.
...
select customername,city,address  from customers where customername is not  null
...
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table
...
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
...
DELETE FROM customers where city='bengaluru'
...
DELETE FROM customers will delete all the records from the customer table
...
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
...
 MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses ROWNUM.

SELECT TOP -sql server
LIMIT - MySQL
ROWNUM-Oracle
...
The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria.
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column.
...
Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:
...
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
...
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
...
mainly used with aggregate fuctions 

 lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers
select employees.lastname,count(orders.orderid)
from (orders inner join employees on Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
group by employees.lastname
where lastname="Davolio" OR lastname="Fuller"
having count(orders.orderid)>25

....
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
DROP DATABASE TESTDB;

...
create table tablename (columnname1 datatype,columnname1 datatype.....);
drop table tablename
alter table tablename   add columnname datatype
...
NOT NULL-the NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.
UNIQUE-The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
 
....
ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE ___ORACLE
ID INT NOT NULL
UNIQUE(ID) ----mysql
...
primary key-
...
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
...
collection of organized data

select usn ,age,name
from student 
where usn=3;
...
proection queries-perticular column
selection queries-perticular row
